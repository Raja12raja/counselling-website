      content="University life can be fun and fulfilling, providing the students various opportunities to acquire new skills and knowledge, develop their character. This is an important milestone before they join the workforce and launch their career.
      However, adjusting to a new environment away from home and managing academic and personal demands may induce high levels of stress and anxiety. Confiding in family or friends is a good coping strategy but if the issues being faced by a student persist over a long period of time, it may be imperative to seek professional help.
      IIT-Indore has a Student Counselling Centre in place that offers supportive and conducive environment for a student wherein he/she can discuss personal issues or academic challenges and seek help from a professional counsellor. The counsellor Ms. Monika Gupta (M.Phil, Clinical Psychology, NIMHANS, and Bangalore) is available to provide help and support for students from diverse religious, cultural and ethnic backgrounds.
      The role of a counsellor is to offer support to the students to deal with a wide range of concerns -be it academic, personal, emotional, family or peer related. Counsellor meets students and their parents as and when needed. Parents and teachers can also approach counsellor over issues pertaining to a young person in their care.
      With the support of the students, parents, other departments and services at IIT Indore, counselling center has been able to effectively meet the needs of students and wishes to continue working for the same."
