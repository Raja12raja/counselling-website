      It is natural for parents to feel anxious and concerned when their wards
      leave home for education. Young people, though away from home, still
      require parents’ continuous involvement, guidance and monitoring. Parents
      need to be aware of their wards’ overall functioning both academic and
      non-academic. It is also advisable for parents to seek feedback from the
      faculty advisors, teachers and/or counsellor.
      <br />
      Parents can approach the counsellor for concerns related to their wards.
      Parents’ feedback to the counsellor facilitates the counselling process
      and enables the parents and counsellor to work together to optimize the
      potential of the young person.
