      The best performance of a student is usually achieved when the student is
      not only hard working, sincere and determined to do well but also
      maintains good physical and psychological health. Numerous factors such as
      time management, financial problems, family problems, and peer related
      issues, emotional problems and perceived stress can create obstacles for
      young people in achieving optimal academic performance.

      The Faculty
      advisors or concerned faculty members can refer a student to the
      Counsellor in case of the following- <br />
      a) A student is feeling stressed out due to academic , personal, family or
      any other reasons
      <br />
      b) A student is showing signs of emotional or psychological distress.
      <br />
      <br />
      Faculty members can play an extremely important role in encouraging the
      students to seek help when needed. The counselling process is a valuable
      aid .It facilitates growth and well being. Faculty membersâ€™ positive
      attitude can reduce the stigma related with counselling services. This in
      turn will help create an environment of flexibility and openness for the
      students.
