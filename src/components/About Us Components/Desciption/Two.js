      At IIT-Indore, the Student Counselling Cell provides a supportive and conducive environment for students to discuss personal issues or academic challenges with professional counselors. Counselors play a crucial role in helping students address various concerns, including academic, personal, emotional, family, or peer-related issues. Counseling helps alleviate distress and enhance well-being by building confidence and teaching effective coping strategies. This facilitates adjustment, personality development, and growth. Through the counseling process, counselors listen to students' concerns with empathy and respond in non-judgmentalÂ way.
